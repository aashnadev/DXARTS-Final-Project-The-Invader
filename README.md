# DXARTS-Final-Project-The-Invader
The Invader is an interactive installation that will explore the lifecycle of the Aurelia Aurita (Moon Jellyfish), through a collection of kinetic sculptures, projected visuals and a digital soundscape composed by James Wenlock. These hauntingly beautiful creatures are not only surviving drastic temperature and acidity changes in the ocean but are also invading other ecological environments and challenging the oceanâ€™s natural balance. The work focuses on the idea of distance, both in the digital and physical realm. From afar these translucent Jellyfish seem beautifully hypnotic, but as we draw closer, the movements and projected videos expose its cancerous like multiplicity.
